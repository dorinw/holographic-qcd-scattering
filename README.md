# Hadron scattering in holographic QCD

This repository hosts the code and data used for the publication:

Adi Armoni, Bartosz Pyszkowski, and Dorin Weissman, **High-Energy Pion Scattering in Holographic QCD: A Comparison with Experimental Data** [<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18274>arXiv:hep-ph/2512.18274</a>]

The code consists of Wolfram Mathematica notebooks used for computing the pion scattering amplitudes in the model prposed in the paper and fitting them to data. The data is given separately in the form of CSV tables, correspoding to data extracted from figure 29 of Bromberg et al, <i>Nucl. Phys. B 232</i> (1984), DOI:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(84)90565-0">10.1016/0550-3213(84)90565-0</a>.
